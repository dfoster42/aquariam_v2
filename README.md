# Aquarium

A living aquarium for mobile and desktop, built in [Godot 4.6](https://godotengine.org).

A rewrite of an earlier Go/Fyne prototype. Fyne capped out around 50 fish at 6 Hz;
this runs hundreds at 60 fps and exports to iOS, Android, desktop and web.

## Running

Open the project in Godot 4.6 and press F5, or:

```bash
godot --path . res://scenes/aquarium.tscn
```

Tap (or click) the tank to drop a fish of the selected species. Drag to pan, pinch to
zoom (mouse wheel on desktop). The bottom row picks a species; the top bar shows the
population and pauses the tank.

A tap and a drag share one finger, so a press stays provisional until it either moves
past `DRAG_SLOP` or is released still enough and soon enough to count as a tap. Only the
release spawns.

## Tests

A headless functional check of spawning, movement, tank bounds and predation:

```bash
godot --headless --script res://test/smoke_test.gd
```

It covers spawning, movement, tank bounds, predation, pause, species selection,
tap-to-spawn, and the safe-area inset arithmetic.

CI runs it on every push and pull request. Note that `godot --script` exits **0** on a
script parse error — measured, not assumed — so a broken test file would otherwise pass
silently. The workflow greps for the test's own `RESULT: PASS` line; that is what
actually gates the build.

## Layout notes

The tank is a fixed world (`tank_size`), not the viewport. A camera looks at part of it,
so fish swim to the edge of the *tank* while the view moves independently.

Every layout container in `ui.tscn` sets `mouse_filter = 2` (IGNORE). A `Control`
defaults to STOP, and one full-rect container left at the default silently swallows
every tap meant for the tank — fish just stop spawning, with no error. The smoke test
asserts this.

`backdrop_tint` multiplies into the backdrop and is white by default. It briefly held a
dimming colour to make the original photograph survivable behind flat vector fish; the
drawn backdrop needs no such help, and applying the old value to it would crush it.

## Adding a species

No code required. Duplicate a resource in `resources/species/`, point it at a
texture, set its stats, then add it to the `Aquarium` node's `available_species`
array in the inspector.

`eats` is the only diet field. Which species *hunt* a given fish is derived from
it at load, so predator and prey can never disagree.

To regenerate the three starting species from scratch:

```bash
godot --headless --script res://tools/generate_species.gd
```

## Art

Sprites are generated through the Antigravity CLI and graded by a second model before
they are allowed into the project.

```bash
python3 tools/art/build.py clownfish                 # cached render, free to re-cut
python3 tools/art/build.py clownfish --force         # re-roll; this is what costs quota
python3 tools/art/build.py shark --ref /tmp/aquarium-art/raw/clownfish.jpg
python3 tools/art/qa.py clownfish shark              # grade shipped sprites
```

The pipeline is adapted from the sprout-party creature-art tooling; the rules it
encodes were learned there, not here.

**The model that made the image does not grade it.** `qa.py` sends the sprite to a
second model against a fixed rubric — an open "does this look right" invites agreement.
It samples twice and unions the failures, because the judge is inattentive rather than
wrong. No parsable JSON is a failure, not a pass. `build.py` stages a render and copies
it into `assets/textures/` only on a clean verdict; `--force-qa` is the only way past
that, and using it belongs in the commit message.

**Every subject reaches the judge as `subject.png`.** The filename is a leak — in the
source pipeline a descriptive name measurably inflated the pass rate.

**The backdrop is drawn, not generated.** `tools/art/draw_background.py` draws it
directly and deterministically:

```bash
python3 tools/art/draw_background.py --out /tmp/aquarium-art/staged/background.jpg
python3 tools/art/qa.py --image /tmp/aquarium-art/staged/background.jpg --kind background
```

Stepped water, a sand floor, rocks and seaweed are almost entirely geometry, and the
source pipeline's rule is that geometry is arithmetic rather than adjectives. Drawing it
is exact, repeatable, and costs no generation quota — which the fish sprites need. It
still goes through the judge, against a background rubric whose items are about staying
out of the fish's way rather than about anatomy.

Two things learned by drawing it wrong first: everything below the waterline is a
silhouette (giving the sand and rocks their own local colour reproduced exactly the
contrast problem the photograph had), and water must be a per-row gradient (four flat
bands leave four visible seams).

`build.py` also understands `kind: background` for a *generated* backdrop, with a brief
at `tools/art/prompts/background.txt`. That path is unused and its generate and judge
steps have never been run — only its downstream half is tested.

Only the render costs quota. It is cached in `/tmp/aquarium-art/raw/`, so re-cutting
after a pipeline change is free. `429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` names a reset time and means
stop; "no image generated in response" is transient and worth one retry.

Transparency comes from a chroma key, not a luminance threshold: briefs ask for flat
magenta, which no fish in the catalogue comes near on any channel. A luma cut would take
the shark's grey back and the clownfish's white bands with it.

**Every sprite faces left.** `scripts/fish.gd` mirrors a fish swimming right, so art
drawn facing right will swim backwards.

resources/species/ one .tres per species
assets/textures/   sprites and tank backdrop
test/              headless checks
tools/             one-shot generators and the screenshot capture
tools/art/         the art pipeline: briefs, generation, keying, QA
```

## Rendering

The project uses the **Compatibility** renderer (OpenGL ES 3.0 / WebGL 2) rather
than Forward+. A 2D sprite scene needs none of what Forward+ adds, Compatibility
has the lowest overhead and widest device floor, and it is the only method that
supports web export. On macOS and iOS, Godot translates it to Metal via ANGLE.

## Notes

Neighbour lookups go through a uniform spatial grid (`scripts/systems/spatial_hash.gd`),
rebuilt once per frame by `Aquarium` and shared by every fish, replacing the
prototype's all-pairs scan.
